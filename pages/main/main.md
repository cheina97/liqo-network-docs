- `tcpdump -tnl -i any \<protocol\>`: capture all traffic for a specific protocol (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, etc.)
- `tcpdump -tnl -i any tcp port 8080`: capture all TCP traffic on port 8080
- `tcpdump -tnl -i any tcp dst port 8080`: capture traffic destined to port 8080
- `conntrack -D`: delete all the conntrack entries
- `conntrack -L`: list all the conntrack entries
- `nft list ruleset`: list all the rules in the nftables
